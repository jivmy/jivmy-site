      "Look at how fast it flies. It's nearing February, and still I remember when this time felt so out of reach. Now, it's here. We're all kind of just drifting through it, clinging on to any possibility of permanence or stability for dear life. It's easy to say \"now is not the right time for this,\" or \"if I do this now, in the future I'll be able to have this.\" But who knows that? We ignore our hearts out of fear that if we were to ask for what we want, we'd face both our own and life's many limitations.",
      "At the same time, there's a degree of truth rooted in our doubts about our dreams. I don't believe in ghosts, but it's never really the right timing, it's true, and we can never have everything we want. In these days, it seems like we give our years to a craft and see it wiped away by a machine in a matter of months. Some parts of me yearn to step away from it all—the call of adventure—lift a house, and just chill out for the rest of my time here. I'm not ready for that yet.",
      "It seems that I'm addicted to the plot, attached to following this rollercoaster path through the world, not ever staying long enough to get disappointed. We really grew up on the final level of the map, didn't we? Spain is a decision that I'll have to sacrifice even more for. I am very much scared... and I will do it. I'll open up the possibilities of life, even though doing so ends some other dreams.",
      "Saying goodbye to this decade long chapter, I'm sitting with a cocktail of anticipation, fear, longing, nostalgia, and determination. It feels very human, in an adult world where we're all just trying to figure it out, balance what we think is right with what we dream about when the lights go out and before the birds chirp.",
      "I have let some people down, and I have raised more up. I have said no to some things, and yes to more. I have seen both sides of luck, and I have told jokes that have made others laugh until their bellies hurt. I have seen more than most, and have loved more than many. In through it all, I have become a better person: more certain that if the world were to crumble, I would remain stable. It's obvious what it could have been, and I'm sorry."

It's such an important vegetable because it pairs well with so many other non-vegetables. It's like that friend who fits in all of your friend groups (me). But it's too general to take the spot of any of the other heavy hitters.",
      "At number four, we have Enoki Mushrooms. I know they're technically a fungi (me) but you sauté these silly little critters in some butter with pepper, pistachios, and white fish—your heart will melt. Next we have Squash. Imagine you're lost in some dark forest everywhere and you finally get out after being stranded for three weeks. Someone comes up to you and gives you two plates of food—you can pick one. In one bowl, you have squash stew. In the other bowl, you have an American spring mix salad...",
      ["Coming up as the runner up to this challenge, we have Morning Glory, or ", <SeriffText key="chinese">空心菜</SeriffText>, ". I have so many memories with this one—childhood dinners, birthdays, anniversaries—it's a killer. I bring it to the boba shop and use it as a straw. At any moment, I have it in my left pants pocket. It makes up 47% of my large intestine. Finally we have the winner of this challenge—Fiddleheads. I have no idea what this vegetable is, but one quick Google search reveals that it's not something to be messed around with. When you eat it your nose gets bigger and and bigger until you become a witch."]

      "Most nights, I'm in their basement—hands on the heavy bag, a shuffle of feet on the floor, Charlie calling out, \"Keep your hands up!\" You soon learn it's not about avoiding every punch: it's about seeing when to take them, how to absorb the impact.",
      "If no shots land here, I'll travel to Wuxi and visit family, then Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Tibet. And then Barcelona for a couple years, cutting across Europe. Guard tight, feet light, steady pace, an ache that burns. In the city, steam rises from manholes, light bends across fire escapes, and cats shuffle out of the winter cold. I hear my own breathing, and the bag swinging like a pendulum.",
