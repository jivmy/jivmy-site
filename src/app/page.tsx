      "All of you know me very well. We've grown up next door to each other. Our parents are friends. We went to college together, interned together, explored the world together. And so all of you know that I got laid off in the winter after Spatial invented a VR Monkey Horror game in July, becoming the biggest thing in the world and blowing up our design team while becoming a game company. Some of you think that I'm stressed, and so you don't know me as well as you think you do. Yes, I care that I was in the same room as the guy who invented Snapchat memories and said \"My cat ate my mom\" in a 9th round interview, yes it makes me cringe. But I don't care that I lost the opportunity. And that's something that I have a hard time explaining to people. Outcomes don't matter to me because I only care about intention and behavior. I do things to become someone, not to get something. So here my intention was to be the kind of person who would fail into no negative affect, not the kind of person who doesn't face adversity.",
      "If I didn't love and crave the struggle, I wouldn't be in New York jobless after dark, not at \"Rumble Boxing,\" no, but at Woodside Boxing Academy, a professional fighting camp. Some guy there just told me that he once visited the country of Maryland, and you can tell me what that means, please. So give me the hardest story possible. Take away all my luck. Strip me of my status. Lay me bare for the man that I am, and bear withness to what happens next.",
      "During training tonight, I had a second thought branch out of my head. Yes, I could book it to Spain, and that's Path A, maybe still default. Now let's run sims on Path B, which is what should have happened already: I go back to a cushy life in Vancouver where I have everything in the world handed to me... but yet, right after Christian hit me with his jab, Path C materialized as an eligible bachelor in front of me. I'm in the best shape of my life. You know how there is all this AI talk about how computers are going to wipe out every job in the world? If that is even a 50% probable outcome, and which it seems at this point that it's higher, why would I not entertain the idea of approaching physical perfection? Screw all that tech shit. In this time of peace, I could just... chill a little bit. It's like that book \"Thinking Fast and Slow.\" It seems natural that I should be moving faster into the next chapter, and yet although counterintuitive, it might be true that I should slow down and chase something else for a little bit—something out of a painting."

It's such an important vegetable because it pairs well with so many other non-vegetables. It's like that friend who fits in all of your friend groups (me). But it's too general to take the spot of any of the other heavy hitters.",
      "At number four, we have Enoki Mushrooms. I know they're technically a fungi (me) but you sauté these silly little critters in some butter with pepper, pistachios, and white fish—your heart will melt. Next we have Squash. Imagine you're lost in some dark forest everywhere and you finally get out after being stranded for three weeks. Someone comes up to you and gives you two plates of food—you can pick one. In one bowl, you have squash stew. In the other bowl, you have an American spring mix salad...",
      ["Coming up as the runner up to this challenge, we have Morning Glory, or ", <SeriffText key="chinese">空心菜</SeriffText>, ". I have so many memories with this one—childhood dinners, birthdays, anniversaries—it's a killer. I bring it to the boba shop and use it as a straw. At any moment, I have it in my left pants pocket. It makes up 47% of my large intestine. Finally we have the winner of this challenge—Fiddleheads. I have no idea what this vegetable is, but one quick Google search reveals that it's not something to be messed around with. When you eat it your nose gets bigger and and bigger until you become a witch."]

      "If no shots land here, I'll travel to Wuxi and visit family, then Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Tibet. And then Barcelona for a couple years, cutting across Europe. Guard tight, feet light, steady pace, an ache that burns. In the city, steam rises from manholes, light bends across fire escapes, and cats shuffle out of the winter cold. I hear my own breathing, and the bag swinging like a pendulum.",
